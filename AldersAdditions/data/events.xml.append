    <text>Upon the stony, sandswept planet below, you can see an Outcast settlement. Its buildings are crumbled and dilapidated, likely the result of an attack or a natural disaster.</text>

        <event>
            <text>Other than some poor weather on its way towards the colony, you encounter no resistance on your way to the surface. As soon as you land your vessel, a group of Outcasts and a Lost Sun quietly approach your group, urging you to come closer.</text>

                    <text>"Careful now, traveler... this planet is quite dangerous! We've heard tales of sandworms out here, massive things that can feel your steps upon the sand a mile away! Our best team of explorers went missing a couple of days ago, and the day after, it burrowed through our streets and knocked down several of our buildings. Suffice to say, we've called off that mission until we can get another team in order to rescue them.</text>

                            <text>Although the Outcasts laugh at your proclamation, they do offer you directions towards the last known location of their exploration team, and you and your crew set out into the sands. If the colony sent an exploration team out here, perhaps there was something they were looking for. You make sure to tread lightly in the hopes of not aggravating whatever these sandworms are, but signs of an oncoming sandstorm and the blazing heat of the sun tell you it might be more difficult than you expected.</text>

                                    <text>It's difficult to navigate the sandstorm, let alone push your body forwards through the blistering wind and abrasive particles. Tremors from the earth and movement in the nearby sands suggest sandworm activity, though your steps are thankfully quiet enough to avoid rousing them. Your crew struggle similarly, eventually stumbling through the dunes to find the remains of a small Chrysolic temple. Though heavily eroded by the relentless sandstorms, it still serves as a good shelter, and likely was the location the Outcast explorers were trying to reach.</text>

    <text>The temple is mostly filled with simple relics and artworks. Few things here are actually worth any scrap, but they seem like they'd be quite valuable to Theocracy-aligned Rockmen.

The collapsing sand releases a couple of Rockmen, who are resilient enough to get back up after a successful resuscitation procedure. Unfortunately, more rumbles from around the temple suggest it's too dangeous to stay for much longer, the sound of your weapon having likely stirred up more sandworms to hunt you down. Your return to the colony is bittersweet, with a funeral held for the remaining expedition members. Even so, the colony offers you a few supplies as thanks.</text>

Splitting your attention between stealth and listening is not easy, but you are able to determine that the station was asking the Rebels to recover a pair of crashed Auto-ships investigating a mysterious shipwreck. Unfortunately, you don't even get the opportunity to read the coordinates you wrote down before the Auto-ship leading the group notices something's off and turns to face you. Even worse, the city's PDS batteries take notice as chatter surges through the facility and the Rebel team!</text>

Perhaps you could do better than some dinky probes, especially since they leaked the coordinates during the session.</text>

    <text>The investigators' directions led you to a beacon in a mostly unpopulated star system. Although it is quite pretty, you know you have to hurry. In orbit around the planet, you can see a massive space station, likely belonging to the so-called "Gazers." It has been constructed in the shape of a massive eye, staring back from the beacon. There are no other ships anywhere in orbit of the planet or the station, suggesting they are the only inhabitants of the system.</text>

        <event>
            <text>The station does not open any communications, and the hangar doors seem to have been left open. It remains on its path in orbit, making it easy to intercept and enter. There aren't even drones in the hangar to service your ship, only a few Rock vessels hastily painted over with black paint and an insignia resembling some sort of three-legged creature. It seems almost as if the station is abandoned.</text>

                    <text>The hallways are not very well-maintained, with patches of rust and dust, chips in the wall, and service doors left hanging open. The lights flicker ominously, and the air feels stale enough that you suspect the station's life support is malfunctioning.</text>

                            <text>Each corridor feels like a maze unto itself, yet all of them lead to a fairly large ritual chamber with a golden statue of a three-legged entity similar to what was depicted on the Rock ships. Monstrous grins are carved into the walls, some big, some small, and several shelves of scripture are scattered around alongside a variety of crates and boxes. You will not have much time before the air becomes unbreathable, so your inspection of the room will have to be quick and dirty.</text>

                                    <text>Although most of the boxes are full of ritual components and basic supplies, a couple of them are crammed full of ammunition. It seems the Gazers were keeping some ammunition on hand in case the situation spiraled out of control. Even better, however, is another box containing timing mechanisms and other electronics; it's likely they jury-rigged some of their spare missiles to launch an attack on the speech.</text>

Being in boxes makes it easier to carry them out of the station, though they are still rather heavy. There isn't enough oxygen left to grab much more, but on your way out of the station, there's a few more supplies to take with you as well.</text>

                                    <text>Never would you have expected to see both Chrysolic and Illesctrian scripture right next to each other on a shelf. The cultists have amassed a collection of holy texts from across the galaxy, likely in an attempt to better understand their own religious experiences. This, of course, pales in comparison to the entire shelf above it of black-covered books, stark and practical in their construction - it would take weeks to read through it all, but it could definitely serve as a way to pass the time or find out more about these Gazers.</text>

Although the texts on other religions would certainly be worth a decent amount of scrap to the right people, you decide to hang onto the Gazer scripture, as it could prove useful in dealing with these cultists. There isn't enough oxygen left to grab much more, but on your way out of the station, there's a few more supplies to take with you as well.</text>
