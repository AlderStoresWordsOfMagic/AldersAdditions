/// FEATURE ADDITIONS ///

Added the Heavy Smasher; it shoots only one projectile but has a much more powerful crush effect.


/// FEATURE CHANGES ///

Reworked Smash weapons entirely (for the second time); they now apply ion when crushing shields instead of a charge speed reduction, and shield-piercing variants now trigger on shield collision like all others.
Made the Smashing Pinpoint and Smashing Bomb unobtainable until the new system can be set to work with them. Their game data and files are still present.

Reworked Firewalled rooms; they now prevent hacking drones from targeting the room at all. Other hack effects behave as they did pre-rework. [TO ADD]


/// BALANCING ///

Smash Laser MK I: new system (2 ion), cooldown 12s -> 10s
Smash Laser MK II: new system (2 ion)
Smashing Missiles: new system (2 ion), cooldown 20s -> 17s


/// BUGFIXES ///

Fixed the Conservative Flak Gun not behaving like other conservative weapons.
Fived the Shock Cannon creating a Lua error every time it fired.
Fixed the Chaotic Combat Projector having the wrong explosion sprite.

Temporary crew spawned from weapons no longer trigger the dialogue box warning you to not leave your crew behind.

Fixed the Chaotic Far-Out Hacker Cruiser crashing on hull kill due to malformed event XML.
Fixed various events behaving poorly due to malformed event XML.

All animation names now use the "aa_" prefix. This means the Railcannon now no longer overlaps its sprite art with certain other addons that add their own railguns, and similar errors are unlikely to exist in the future.
All spritework has been compressed in a lossless manner, reducing the overall file size of the mod.
